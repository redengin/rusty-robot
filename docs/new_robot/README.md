Creating your own robot
================================================================================
If you have the passion, **there is a world of support to assist you**.

Always look for pivots - alternatives that reduce the cost and/or increase the
capacity.

Step 1 - Explain your concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a simple document that explains:
* What does this robot do?
    * a paragraph to describe your need
* Why does this robot improve your life?
    * a paragraph to describe *how* it impacts you
    * a paragraph to describe *where* it will be used

From this short description, you can reach out to the community to identify if
there are others working on a similar concept.

Step 2 - Model your robot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To realize your robot, the system needs to be physically possible.
[Modeling](../best-practices/modeling.md) allows you to describe the physical
needs and then leverage automated analysis to determine if system can meet those
needs.

The community is happy to help you (provide the following information)
* simple diagram of what the robot looks like
    * explanation of what movements are required

Step 3 (optional) - Mechanical Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Put the mechanical apparatus through it's manuevers to validate capability.


Step 4 - Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose digital components from the [supported list](/docs/componenents.md).

Step 5 - System Test
* Leverage the self-test methods to ascertain if the hardware is working correctly
* repeat the task(s) until confident of repeatable performance
