Creating your own robot
================================================================================
If you have the passion, **there is a world of support to assist you**.

Always look for pivots - alternatives that reduce the cost and/or increase the
capacity.

Step 1 - Explain your concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a simple document that explains why this robot should exist:
* a paragraph (or sometimes more) for each;
    * *why* - what need does this robot serve?
    * *where* - what environments does this robot need to operate in?
    * *how* - what operations does this robot perform?
        * what does the robot need to sense about the world?
        * what does the robot need to "do" to the world?

From this short description, you can reach out to the community to identify if
there are others working on a similar concept.

Step 2 - Model your robot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To realize your robot, the system needs to be physically possible.
[Modeling](../best_practices/modeling.md) allows you to describe the physical
needs and then leverage automated analysis to determine if system can meet those
needs.

The community is happy to help you (provide the following information)
* simple diagram of what the robot looks like
    * be able (or learn how) to provide physical data about your robot

With a well-defined **model** you can then simulate your robot using a physics
engine (see [simulator](../../simulator/README.md)).
