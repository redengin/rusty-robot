Rust Workspace
================================================================================
IDEs (i.e. vscode rust-analzyer) leverage 
[Rust workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).
By using this **workspace** you can easily develop code across this repository
(without having to create new IDE environments for each Rust package).
