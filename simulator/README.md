Rusty Robot Simulation
================================================================================
Simulators allow the designer to test out their control algorithms in a
simulated physical environment. By leveraging simulation, you can dramatically
reduce the testing costs.

Choosing a simulator
================================================================================
**Simulation is only valuable if it reduces costs.**

Costs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **effort** - how difficult is it for a novice to create the simulation?
* **time** - how long does it take to create and maintain the models for simulation?

Our simulator

We are using [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org).
